What I learned in taking the *Data Visualization and Storytelling* class is there is a balance to strike between the science to making data driven decisions, and the art of conveying information-this applies whether you are a leader trying to get buy in from the team, or as a team member trying to accurately describe your insights to the project manager. This was one of the most amazing experiences I had in the program, since the instructor covered the history of data storytelling, and then taught us how to become effective at doing it ourselves.
