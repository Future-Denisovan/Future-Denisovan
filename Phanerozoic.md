
Dan and I were assigned to the same study group in the program, and immediately we starting sharing our ideas of how powerful effective use of data was. About halfway through the summer term, Dan proposed an idea to me. Since we were both veterans we understood how torturous the process was of filing a VA claim. He knew someone at the American Legion, which was a non-profit group that assisted veterans in filing claims. How it worked is that a veteran would schedule an hour to meet with the volunteer who assisted in filing the claim, so that it was filed correctly and the veteran would receive the benefits they deserved. The issue was that many individual medical records were thousands of pages long, and there was not enough time for the non-profit to parse through and find the information that was most important for the claim, resulting in delayed or incomplete claims.

*The GUI I created in order to allow the non-profit group to search through scanned PDFs*

We built a program using Python that reads unstructured data in the form of scanned PDFs(more complex to handle than embedded data in PDFs) into a dataset. As the data was read, the program locates the terms that the user needs and provides them in the form of a indexed keywords. I designed a graphical user interfaced for the program that allows someone at the American Legion to select what folder all the medical records were in. This experience elevated my sights I had learned in less than 4 months more than I had thought. If you had asked me when I started the MSBA program if I could accomplish this I would have told you no-I did not realize what two dedicated people could achieve.
